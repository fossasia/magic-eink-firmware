# Magic Epaper Firmware

**Magic Epaper Firmware** is a customizable and efficient firmware designed to control FOSSASIA's epaper displays. This project is ideal for applications such as smart signage, dashboards, IoT devices, and more, providing a seamless interface for rendering content on e-ink screens.

## Features

- **Optimized for the FOSSSASIA epaper Display**: Smooth rendering with minimal power consumption.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to customize for different e-paper display sizes and types.
- **Low-Power Operations**: Designed for battery-powered devices.
- **Flexible Connectivity**:
  - Supports communication over SPI, I2C, or UART.
  - Compatible with the following microcontroller
- **Rich Content Rendering**:
  - Text, images, and custom graphics.
  - Support for grayscale and partial refresh (depending on the display).
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source firmware under the Apache2 license.

## Supported Displays

The firmware currently supports the following e-ink displays:
- FOSSASIA e-paper display.
- Generic SPI-based e-ink displays.

For other displays, you can add support by modifying the display driver module.
